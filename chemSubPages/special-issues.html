        <p>ChemSci Advances welcomes proposals for special issues that align with the journalâ€™s scope and
          objectives. Special issues provide an opportunity to delve into specific topics or emerging
          areas within chemical sciences and related fields, offering a focused platform for in-depth
          exploration and discussion.</p>
        <p>If you have a proposal for a special issue, please submit it to the editorial office for
          consideration. Your proposal should include a brief outline of the proposed topic, its
          significance and relevance to the field, potential contributors, and a proposed timeline for
          publication.
        </p>
        <p>Once your proposal is received, it will undergo careful evaluation by the editorial team to
          assess its suitability for publication in ChemSci Advances. If approved, you will be invited to
          serve as a guest editor or co-editor for the special issue, working closely with the editorial
          team to oversee the review and publication process.</p>
