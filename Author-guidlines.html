                                                <p><strong>Abbreviations:</strong> In instances where abbreviations are
                                                    not commonly recognized within the field, it is imperative to define
                                                    them in a footnote on the first page of the article. Additionally,
                                                    any abbreviations deemed necessary in the abstract should be defined
                                                    at their initial mention within the abstract itself and reiterated
                                                    in the footnote. Consistency in the use of abbreviations throughout
                                                    the article is crucial for clarity and comprehension. Therefore,
                                                    authors should ensure uniformity in the application of abbreviations

                                                    accepted rules and conventions is paramount when presenting
                                                    nomenclature and units within a manuscript. The use of the
                                                    International System of Units (SI) is strongly recommended. In cases
                                                    where other units or quantities are referenced, it is essential to
                                                    provide their equivalents in SI units. Authors are encouraged to
                                                    consult authoritative sources such as the International Union of

                                                <p>The manuscript structure outlined here provides a systematic
                                                    framework for organizing and presenting research findings in a
                                                    clear, coherent, and comprehensive manner. Each section plays a
                                                    distinct yet interconnected role in communicating the research
                                                    process, outcomes, and implications to the scientific community.</p>
                                                <p>Title of the Manuscript: The title should accurately reflect the
                                                    content and focus of the research.</p>
                                                <p><b>Abstract:</b> A succinct and informative abstract is necessary for
                                                    any research manuscript. It should succinctly outline the research’s
                                                    objectives, key findings, and principal conclusions. Since abstracts
                                                    are often read independently of the full article, they must
                                                    effectively summarize the study’s essence. Authors should refrain
                                                    from using non-standard or uncommon abbreviations. If unavoidable,
                                                    such abbreviations must be defined upon their first mention within
                                                    the abstract itself to ensure clarity and comprehension. Thus, a
                                                    concise and informative abstract, not exceeding 250 words, should be
                                                    included.</p>

                                                    must maintain a minimum resolution of 300 dots per inch (dpi) to
                                                    guarantee optimal clarity and legibility. Compliance with these
                                                    standards ensures seamless integration of figures into the
                                                    manuscript and enhances their visual impact.</p>

                                                <p><b>Tables:</b> Tables play a fundamental role in organizing and
                                                    presenting data in a structured and accessible format. Proper
                                                    formatting and presentation of tables are essential to facilitate

                                                <p><b>Editability and Format:</b> Authors are advised to ensure that
                                                    tables are editable and provided in DOC or DOCX format. This enables
                                                    ease of access and manipulation, allowing for efficient formatting
                                                    adjustments or updates as necessary. Providing tables in editable
                                                    formats enhances their usability and facilitates any necessary

                                                    coherently. Clear formatting and consistent use of fonts and styles
                                                    contribute to the overall professionalism and readability of the

                                                    could sway the outcomes or give rise to a perception of partiality.
                                                    Authors should provide a clear statement indicating any conflicts of

                                               <h4>Authorship Changes:</h4>

                                                <p>Authors are strongly advised to carefully deliberate the composition
                                                    and sequence of authors before submitting their manuscript. The
                                                    final roster of authors should be furnished upon initial submission.
                                                    Any modifications to the authorship—whether additions, deletions, or
                                                    reordering—must be proposed prior to the manuscript’s acceptance and
                                                    necessitate approval from the Editor. To initiate an authorship
                                                    change, the corresponding author must furnish the Editor with the
                                                    following: (a) A comprehensive rationale for the proposed alteration
                                                    in the author list. (b) Written confirmation, such as an email or
                                                    letter, from all authors endorsing the addition, removal, or
                                                    reordering of authors. In cases of additions or removals, consent
                                                    from the affected author is also mandated. Exceptions to this
                                                    protocol are granted sparingly. Requests for authorship adjustments
                                                    post-acceptance will be evaluated by the Editor, albeit only under
                                                    extraordinary circumstances. Throughout the deliberation process,
                                                    publication of the manuscript will be temporarily halted. In
                                                    instances where the manuscript has already been published online,
                                                    any approved changes will be accompanied by a corrigendum.</p>
