            <p>At present, there are no article processing charges (APCs) associated with publishing in SciEngg
                Advances. As an open-access journal, all articles are published free of cost to authors. The publisher
                covers the expenses incurred in the publication process, allowing authors to disseminate their research
                without any financial burden. There are no fees for submission, processing, or publication of articles
                in SciEngg Advances. This approach ensures equitable access to scientific knowledge and supports the
                dissemination of research findings across the global scientific community.</p>
