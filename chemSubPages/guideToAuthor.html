Authors should also specify whether written or verbal consent was obtained and provide assurance that participants’ rights were respected throughout the research process.</p>
        
                <h5><b>Acknowledgements:</b></h5>
                <p>The Acknowledgements section provides authors with the opportunity to express gratitude to individuals or organizations that contributed to the research project but do not meet the criteria for authorship. This may include funding agencies, research assistants, technical support staff, or colleagues who provided valuable feedback or assistance. Authors should ensure that all individuals acknowledged have granted permission to be included in the Acknowledgements section.</p>
        
                <h5><b>Conflict of Interest:</b></h5>
                <p>Authors must declare any potential conflicts of interest that could be perceived as influencing the research process or the interpretation of the findings. This may include financial interests, employment affiliations, consulting arrangements, or personal relationships that could bias the results or create the perception of bias. Authors should provide a clear statement indicating any conflicts of interest and describe how they were managed throughout the research process to maintain integrity and objectivity.</p>
        
                <h5><b>Authorship Changes:</b></h5>
                <p>Authors are strongly advised to carefully deliberate the composition and sequence of authors before submitting their manuscript. The final roster of authors should be furnished upon initial submission. Any modifications to the authorship—whether additions, deletions, or reordering—must be proposed prior to the manuscript’s acceptance and necessitate approval from the Editor. To initiate an authorship change, the corresponding author must furnish the Editor with the following: (a) A comprehensive rationale for the proposed alteration in the author list. (b) Written confirmation, such as an email or letter, from all authors endorsing the addition, removal, or reordering of authors. In cases of additions or removals, consent from the affected author is also mandated. Exceptions to this protocol are granted sparingly. Requests for authorship adjustments post-acceptance will be evaluated by the Editor, albeit only under extraordinary circumstances. Throughout the deliberation process, publication of the manuscript will be temporarily halted. In instances where the manuscript has already been published online, any approved changes will be accompanied by a corrigendum.</p>
