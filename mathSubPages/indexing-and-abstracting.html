                <p>MatSci Express, while currently not indexed, is actively working towards being indexed in prominent
                    databases and directories relevant to materials science and related fields. Our aim is to ensure
                    that the valuable research published in MatSci Express reaches a wide audience of scholars,
                    researchers, and practitioners in the field. We are in the process of applying for indexing in key
                    databases and directories to enhance the visibility and discoverability of articles published in our
                    journal. Stay tuned for updates as we progress in our efforts to expand the indexing coverage of
                    MatSci Express, thereby increasing its impact and reach within the scientific community.</p>
